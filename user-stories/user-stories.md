# User Stories

## Story 1: 
As a guest, I want to register and create an account using my email or a social media login, so that I can securely log in and start searching for properties. The registration process should include email verification to confirm my identity, and my account should be assigned the “Guest” role by default, enabling me to access all guest-specific features.

## Story 2:
As a guest, I want to book a property for selected dates, so that I can reserve a stay without having conflicts with other bookings. The system should validate availability to prevent double-booking, update the booking status from pending to confirmed, and send me a confirmation notification or email once the reservation is successful.

## Story 3:
As a host, I want to create, edit, and delete property listings so that I can manage the properties I want to rent out. I should be able to add detailed information about my properties, including a title, a description, the location, the price, and the amenities, as well as upload photos. Only I, the property owner, should have permission to update or remove my listings.

## Story 4:
As a guest, I want to pay for my bookings using a reliable payment gateway, so that I can complete reservations with confidence. Payments should be handled via platforms like Stripe or PayPal, support multiple currencies, trigger notifications for both guests and hosts, and ensure that hosts receive automatic payouts after the booking is completed.

## Story 5: 
As a guest, I want to leave a review and rating for a property after my stay, so that I can share my experience and help other guests make informed decisions. Reviews should only be allowed for completed bookings, be linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse and hosts should have the ability to respond. Property and host average ratings should be updated automatically.

## Story 6: 
As a host, I want to view all bookings for my properties, including pending, confirmed, and completed reservations, so that I can prepare for upcoming guests and manage my availability efficiently. The system should allow me to respond to bookings, communicate with guests, and track the status of all reservations.
